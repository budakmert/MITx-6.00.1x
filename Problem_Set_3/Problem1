# Problem 1
# 10/10 point (graded)
# Please read the Hangman Introduction before starting this problem. We'll start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily
# code the Hangman problem. First, implement the function isWordGuessed that takes in two parameters - a string, secretWord, and a list
# of letters, lettersGuessed. This function returns a boolean - True if secretWord has been guessed (ie, all the letters of secretWord
# are in lettersGuessed) and False otherwise.

# Example Usage:
# >>> secretWord = 'apple' 
# >>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
# >>> print(isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed))
# False

# For this function, you may assume that all the letters in secretWord and lettersGuessed are lowercase.

 def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    x = list(set(secretWord))
    for i in range(0,len(secretWord)+1):
        if x[i] not in lettersGuessed:
            return False
        else: 
            return True
